I created this project using HTML and CSS files. I have additionally used a 960 grid frame, to organize this website. 

This is a news website, deriving news articles from BBC.com.

The highlight of this project is the pure css parallax effect I have used using ztransform. Along with the 960 gris system used, implementing the 24 section css file.

I have used a custom single css file for both the webpages created. along with the 960_24_col.css , reset.css, and text.css files.
